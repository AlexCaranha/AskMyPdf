# AskMyPdf

**AskMyPdf** is an open source application that transforms PDF files into searchable sources through natural language. With support for local or remote LLMs, the system allows you to upload documents, ask questions in natural language, and receive answers based on the actual content of the PDFs ‚Äî all using vector embeddings and semantic search techniques.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Chat with your PDFs:** Ask questions and get answers based on the actual content of your documents.
- **Semantic search:** Uses embeddings and FAISS for fast and relevant search.
- **LLM integration:** Connects to local or remote LLM servers (OpenAI-compatible APIs).
- **Modern API:** Built with FastAPI and LangServe, with an interactive playground for testing.
- **Containerization:** Production-ready with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Extensible:** Easy to adapt for new document types, LLMs, or workflows.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
PDF_PATH=/pdfs
```

### 2. Add your PDFs

Place your PDF files in the directory specified by `PDF_PATH` (default: `/pdfs`).

### 3. Run the application with Docker Compose
